I thoroughly enjoyed the learning process at RS School and realized that I made the right choice in both selecting the school and the profession. I can't wait to apply my new skills in practice and continue to grow in this field.`,

When choosing a profession, I considered going in this direction, but it turned out differently. And a few years ago I realized that now is my second chance to become a developer. Now I am moving in the direction I dreamed of. 
I started my journey with Python, took a course on Deep Learning and then got to know web development. And I realized that I found my direction. Now my aspirations and desires are aimed at becoming a professional frontend developer.`,
